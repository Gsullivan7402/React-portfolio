# React Portfolio

## Description

This React Portfolio is a single-page application designed to showcase the projects and skills of a web developer. Built with React, it leverages modern web technologies to present a polished and interactive user experience. The portfolio includes sections like About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, all navigable through a responsive header. This project is deployed on Netlify and highlights my abilities in creating SPA (Single Page Applications) that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
